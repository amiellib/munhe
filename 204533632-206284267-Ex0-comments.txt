copy constructor should use copy function
area: should be exception not return 0
      and was asked to ignore the area under line of x=0
      Polynom p2 = new Polynom("x");
      System.out.println(p2.area(-2, 2, 0.01));
      should bring in 2 but we get 4.

good project over all


javadocs:
polynom : some params and returns are missing explaination
